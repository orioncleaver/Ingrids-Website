Ingrid's Scandinavian Food is a family-owned restaurant located in the heart of historic Downtown Oregon City.
Ingrid's was founded by a mother-daughter duo with a vision to combine their Traditional Norweigan family recipes with locally sourced ingredients to create a Scandinavian menu that is unique to the Pacific Northwest. 
Ingrid's started as a food truck in SE Portland in 2014. 
After two years, the mother-daughter duo decided to move their operation to a brick and mortar restaurant in Oregon City to help expand their catering services and to take part in the rapidly expanding Oregon City food scene.

Every morning, one of the owners is at the restaurant making a fresh batch of lefse for the day. Lefse is a Norweigan potato-based flat bread that we use to make the wraps.
